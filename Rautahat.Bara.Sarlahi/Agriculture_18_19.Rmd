## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.






When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r Agriculture_18_19, echo=FALSE}
summary(Agriculture_18_19$hrs_irr_1katha/0.0339)
```

## Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

hist(Agriculture_18_19$when_is_crop_harvested,col = "lightblue",main = "When is crop harvested")
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE}

hist(Agriculture_18_19$most_imp_source,col = "blue",main = "source ")
```
